    <para id="id8481559">By the time Oscar Wilde’s poem <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> appeared in June 1894, with decorations 
and illustrations by Charles Ricketts, Wilde had been working on the poem 
intermittently for at least eleven years. The timing was opportune, as was the 
choice of publishers (John Lane and Elkin Mathews in London, “at the Sign of the 
Bodley Head,” and, simultaneously, Copeland and Day in Boston). The previous 
February, Mathews and Lane had issued the first English-language edition of 
Wilde’s play <emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis>, translated into 
English by Lord Alfred Douglas and “pictured” by Aubrey Beardsley (like 
<emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>, this book was simultaneously 
issued in Boston by Copeland and Day). And the first volume of the soon-to-be-
notorious illustrated quarterly <emphasis effect="italics">The Yellow 
Book</emphasis> had appeared in April, again published by Mathews and Lane in 
London and, one month later, by Copeland and Day in Boston. The English 
Decadence was at its height, fanned into flames by Wilde’s own English 
publishers from their bookshop in London’s Vigo Street (“The Bodley Head,” named 
for its street sign displaying the head of the Renaissance scholar-diplomat 
Thomas Bodley, founder of the Bodleian Library). And thanks to the offices of 
Copeland and Day, those flames were beginning to reach the United States (see 
Kraus; and Weir, 50-74) where, as other works published in the Literature By 
Design Series show, their effects on American writers and artists would be 
considerable. Only an Act of Parliament would “meet the case,” the <emphasis effect="italics">Westminster Gazette</emphasis> had declared of the first volume 
of <emphasis effect="italics">The Yellow Book</emphasis>, the previous April, 
“to make this kind of thing illegal” (quoted in Mix, 88). Although the <emphasis effect="italics">succès de scandale</emphasis> of such works as <emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">The Yellow 
Book</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> would 
eventually lead to a permanent breakdown of the 
partnership between the conservative Mathews and the more adventurous Lane, in 
the summer of 1894 Mathews and Lane were bringing to a fever pitch certain 
movements in the literary and textual arts that were to have long-standing 
effects on the course of literature and design in the English-speaking world. 
Not for nothing did the poet and critic W. E. Henley comment, upon reviewing 
<emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> in the <emphasis effect="italics">Pall Mall Gazette</emphasis> in July 1894, that it was “about 
as <emphasis effect="italics">fin de siècle</emphasis> a business as you ever 
saw” (Henley, 168).</para>
    <para id="id11360056">Exact dates for when Wilde began composing <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> and when he completed it to his 
satisfaction are hard to determine precisely (see “Origins of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>”<emphasis effect="italics"/>below). But 
there is little doubt that <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> 
occupied a large portion of Wilde’s life and, along with his <emphasis effect="italics">Poems</emphasis> and “The Portrait of Mr. W. H.,” it was at the 
forefront of Wilde’s mind when late in 1891 he decided to transfer his 
publishing arrangements to Mathews and Lane. As Wilde would have been acutely 
aware, the Bodley Head was rapidly developing “a reputation for breaking with 
conventions—not only literary conventions, but social and moral ones” (Stetz, 
72). Before Wilde joined their list, Mathews and Lane had already published, or 
were on the point of publishing, important work by the young poets of the 
Rhymers’ Club and by older poets such as Philip Bourke Marston and Lord De 
Tabley, noted for their affinities with the Pre-Raphaelite Movement. Just as 
important, they published emerging women writers such Katherine Bradley and 
Edith Cooper (who wrote jointly and published under the pseudonym “Michael 
Field”), and Dollie Radford. Over the coming months, that list would be 
supplemented by such important <emphasis effect="italics">fin de 
siècle</emphasis> writers as Arthur Symons, John Gray, John Davidson, “George 
Egerton” (Mary Chavelita Dunne) and John Addington Symonds, among others. A 
“Vigo Street School” (Nelson, <emphasis effect="italics">The Early 
Nineties</emphasis>, 300) was coming into existence, and the Bodley Head was 
rapidly becoming a home to writers and book artists of what is now termed the 
Decadent Movement. Five of Wilde’s works (but not “The Portrait of Mr. W. H.”) 
were to be published by the firm over the ensuing years before Wilde’s 
imprisonment in 1895.<footnote id="id6242090">Only four of Wilde’s books 
appeared with both Mathews’s and Lane’s names on the title page. Though Wilde 
had arranged with Mathews and Lane for the publication of <emphasis effect="italics">A Woman of No Importance</emphasis> in 1893, the acrimonious 
split between the two publishers in the summer of 1894 threw Wilde’s publishing 
arrangements into disarray, and the book eventually appeared in October 1894 
under Lane’s name alone. <emphasis effect="italics">A Woman of No 
Importance</emphasis> was not merely the last of Wilde’s books to be published 
“at the sign of the Bodley Head,” but also the last to be published before his 
imprisonment and bankruptcy, with the exception of the privately printed 
selection <emphasis effect="italics">Oscariana</emphasis> (London: Arthur 
Humphreys, 1895). For the acrimonious split between Mathews and Lane, see 
Nelson, <emphasis effect="italics">The Early Nineties</emphasis>, 266-79. For 
Wilde’s preferred publication arrangements following the split, see <emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 604-613 passim.</footnote></para>
    <para id="id5584318">When he chose Mathews and Lane as publishers for 
<emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>, then, Wilde was making a 
calculated decision about the company his work would keep as well as the form in 
which his works would be issued: as Stetz remarks, “the phrase ‘Bodley Head 
book’ came to possess a particular meaning and…raised a quite specific set of 
expectations” (Stetz, 71). Prominent among those expectations was the firm’s 
reputation for publishing what Tennyson would have termed “poisonous honey 
stolen from the flowers of France” (quoted Nelson, <emphasis effect="italics">The Early Nineties</emphasis>, 184)—poetry “heavily 
influenced by Swinburne, [that] belonged to what was known in the Victorian 
period as the ‘fleshly school’—sensuous rhymes constructed around sensual 
subjects” (Stetz, 72; see Nelson, <emphasis effect="italics">The Early 
Nineties</emphasis>, 184-220). But no less important was the reputation of 
Mathews and Lane for producing books whose physical appearance and design belied 
their relatively low cost. Close attention was given to such matters as paper 
quality and texture, binding materials (usually dyed cloth), typeface, and page 
layout. Master printers such as Walter Blaikie, of the firm T. and A. Constable, 
or Ballantyne Hanson and Co. of Edinburgh, were employed for printing purposes; 
and designers of considerable talent were employed to decorate—but not 
necessarily to illustrate—the book. Many of these designers—Walter Crane, 
William Strang, Aubrey Beardsley, Charles Ricketts, Laurence Housman—are now 
renowned as “artists” in their own right, and although they were occasionally 
commissioned to contribute illustrations, as in the case of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> or Wilde’s <emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis>, they were more typically employed by Mathews 
and Lane to contribute a distinctive gilt-stamped cover design, an original 
frontispiece, or an attractive title page (or all three) to the Bodley Head 
book. If, as Wilde contended, “what is interesting about people in good society…
is the mask that each one of them wears, not the reality behind the mask” (“The 
Decay of Lying,” 297), such decorative details constituted the “mask” in which 
the literary work engaged its public, and they bore out Wilde’s longstanding 
contention that any visual performance or staging was dependent upon “small 
details of dress” (“The Truth of Masks,” 410). The fact that Bodley Head books 
were issued in strictly limited editions, typically in print runs of a few 
hundred copies, with twenty-five or fifty extra copies printed on larger paper 
to be sold as a special or “deluxe” edition, added to their air of exclusivity 
and other-worldliness.<footnote id="id10299143">In this respect, as Margaret 
Stetz has argued, Mathews and Lane made a virtue of necessity brilliantly, since 
the small batches of often-remaindered paper that they bought cheaply meant that 
they were forced to limit the number of copies printed (Stetz, 74). </footnote> 
All of these traits are evident in the edition of <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Sphinx</emphasis> reproduced here: Henley might just as easily have remarked, 
upon reviewing the book, that it was “about as Bodley Head a business,” or as 
typical a Bodley Head business, “as you ever saw.”<footnote id="id12396553">Although <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> 
represents the epitome of the Bodley Head’s practice of issuing finely printed 
books containing a strong graphic or decorative component, it was nonetheless 
the most expensive book in their 1894 catalogue, and in some ways even the 
standard issue comes closer to private press books of the period than to the 
most common Bodley Head books. Ricketts’s admiration for the work of William 
Morris is well documented, and although <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Sphinx</emphasis> is designed according to very different principles from those 
applied by William Morris in the design and printing of books issued by Morris’s 
Kelmscott Press (1891-1898), the influence of Morris’s “typographical adventure” 
upon <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> is palpable. 
Significantly, <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> was printed on 
specially made unbleached paper (laid paper for the standard issue: handmade 
paper for the large-paper copies) bearing the watermark of Ricketts’s own 
private press, the Vale Press; and paper so watermarked was subsequently used 
again, repeatedly, by Ricketts for the production of books emanating from the 
Vale Press. Nonetheless, Ricketts refused to consider <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx </emphasis>to be a "Vale book" since it was "without 
woodcuts" (<emphasis effect="italics">A Defence</emphasis>, 
24).</footnote></para>
    <para id="id6484278">Wilde duly entered into an agreement with Mathews and 
Lane in the Summer of 1892 for publication of <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Sphinx</emphasis> with decorations by Charles Ricketts. The timing of the 
agreement is interesting in its own right: <emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">The Yellow 
Book</emphasis>—the two works on account of which publication of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> would eventually be delayed, and with 
which its fate would to some extent be associated upon publication—were not yet 
on the horizon, at least so far as Mathews and Lane were concerned.<footnote id="id9782314"><emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis> had been written in 
French, and it remained untranslated into English when Wilde committed to 
publish <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>. At some point in the 
fall of 1892, Wilde arranged for <emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis> to 
be published by the Librairie de L’Art Indépendent, in French, in Paris the 
following February, paying all printing expenses himself. In November 1892, 
Wilde agreed verbally that Mathews and Lane could distribute this edition in 
Britain, in consequence of which their names were added to the title page and 
the print run increased. In a letter to John Lane dated Feb. 1893, Wilde 
complained that he had still received no written agreement from Lane and “the 
fact of your name being on the title page was an act of pure courtesy and 
compliment on my part” (<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 
546). <emphasis effect="italics">The Yellow Book </emphasis>was not conceived 
until New Year’s Day 1894 (Mix, 68) according to its literary editor, although 
this date has been questioned by Stetz. See Mix, 66-72 and Stetz, <emphasis effect="italics">The Yellow Book</emphasis>, 12-17.</footnote> And in summer 
1892 Wilde was, by some accounts, reeling from the actions of England’s Lord 
Chamberlain, who in June 1892 had refused to license the first stage production 
of <emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis>—with Sarah Bernhardt in the 
title role, and despite the fact that rehearsals for the production were well 
advanced—on the grounds that the play contravened an ancient statute prohibiting 
the depiction on English stages of Biblical characters. Publicly at least, Wilde 
was promising to “leave England and settle in France…[unwilling] to call myself 
a citizen of a country that shows such narrowness in its artistic judgement” 
(Mikhail, 1:188). But since Mathews and Lane had done an exemplary job of 
publishing the “Author’s Edition” of Wilde’s <emphasis effect="italics">Poems,</emphasis><footnote id="id10827967">The 220 (230?) 
copies (Nelson, <emphasis effect="italics">A Checklist</emphasis>, 35) of the 
Author’s Edition of Wilde’s <emphasis effect="italics">Poems</emphasis>, priced 
at 15/-, sold out within days; and although Elkin Mathews’s contract with Wilde 
(Nelson <emphasis effect="italics">The Early Nineties</emphasis>, 96) stipulated 
a twenty percent commission for the publisher, as well as precise limits for the 
cost of advertising, design, block-making and binding, it must have earned Wilde 
a reasonable profit. </footnote> the first of Wilde’s works to be published “at 
the sign of the Bodley Head,” in late May of 1892, there is reason to speculate 
that it was in large part the prospect of Mathews and Lane publishing his future 
books that kept Wilde from carrying out his threat to emigrate to Paris, where 
his involvement in the leading literary circles, especially with such writers as 
Mallarmé, Gide and Louÿs, was considerable.</para>
    <para id="id16828725">According to the terms of his contract with Mathews 
and Lane, Wilde was to receive a ten percent royalty for the poem (Nelson, 
<emphasis effect="italics">The Early Nineties</emphasis>, 96-97), though he 
complained to his publishers that “I did not contemplate assigning to you the 
copyright of so important a poem for so small an honorarium,” and he accepted 
their terms only on condition “that no new edition is to be brought out without 
my sanction: I mean no such thing as a popular or cheap edition is to be brought 
out: nor are you to be able to assign the right of publishing the poem to any 
other firm” (<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 533-34). 
Wilde’s concern for the kind of book to be published, as well as his lack of 
faith in other publishers doing justice to his work, will be clear from these 
comments. But his agreement with Mathews and Lane is interesting for other 
reasons as well: we can detect something of the importance Wilde attached to the 
poem, as well as the importance of poetry to his own conception of himself, in 
the care with which Wilde changed “author” to “poet” throughout the contract, 
insisting to his publishers upon returning it that “the maker of a poem is a 
‘poet,’ not an ‘author’: ‘author’ is misleading” (<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 533). More significantly and 
unusually, the contract was a joint one, co-signed not only by Wilde and his 
publishers but also by Charles Ricketts, the book’s designer; and at the same 
time as it specified the terms upon which Wilde was to receive an author’s (or 
poet’s) royalty, it specified the exact terms upon which “the artist” would 
execute, submit, and be paid for his work. Thus it stipulates that “the artist 
will…submit to the publishers for their approval ten designs for decorating, 
colouring, and fully illustrating the Poem, also specimens of paper and other 
material and binding” (quoted Nelson, <emphasis effect="italics">The Early 
Nineties</emphasis>, 96). At the same time it assigned to Ricketts an unusual 
degree of responsibility for overseeing the book’s printing and binding: “The 
artist will execute and see to the reproduction of the designs…and prepare for 
and superintend through the press the said work, and will make arrangements for 
the supply of all materials and labour for printing, issuing and binding the 
first and other editions thereof according to his own judgment but at the 
expense of the publishers” (quoted Nelson, <emphasis effect="italics">The Early 
Nineties</emphasis>, 96). No less than the resulting book itself, the publishing 
agreement for <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx </emphasis>raises graphic 
design to the status of “art,” places the book’s designer on a footing parallel 
to its author (or “poet”), and above all treats art and poetry as interdependent 
entities, at least so far as commercial and legal considerations are 
concerned.</para>
    <para id="id16241262">This elevation of design to the status of art owes 
something to the personal determination of Charles Ricketts, 
designer/illlustrator of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>, to be 
understood as an artist in his own right. Ricketts shared this determination 
with other Bodley Head designers such as Aubrey Beardsley, Walter Crane and 
Laurence Housman, and it is not irrelevant here to note that Ricketts would 
later be elected to the Royal Academy, his paintings and sculptures collected by 
the Tate, the Ashmolean, the Carlisle City Museum, the Manchester Art Gallery, 
and the Fitzwilliam, among other major English galleries. As telling, Ricketts 
would later become an important authority on art in his own right, composing 
books on Titian and The Prado, and serving as advisor to the Canadian National 
Gallery after previously declining to direct the National Gallery in London. 
</para>
    <para id="id5721963">But the elevation of the book’s design to the status of 
art also owes much to Wilde, whose personal and intellectual interest in design 
had been longstanding by 1892. In January 1889, for instance, he had written 
that “our aim should be to discover some mode of illustration that will 
harmonise with the shapes of our letters” (“Some Literary Notes I,” 392). Two 
months earlier, he had written that “no ornament or illustration should be used 
in a book which cannot be printed in the same way as the type” while pleading 
for “harmony” between a book’s “type and the decoration” (“Printing and 
Printers,” 100-1). These remarks had been made in the course of reviewing a 
lecture on “Printing” that Emery Walker delivered to the Arts and Crafts Society 
on November 15, 1888—the third of five lectures on the arts of design delivered 
to members of the Arts and Crafts Society, which Wilde reviewed enthusiastically 
for the <emphasis effect="italics">Pall Mall Gazette</emphasis> in November 
1888. (This lecture series is now generally regarded by scholars as constituting 
an epochal moment in the Arts and Crafts Movement. Emery Walker’s lecture on 
printing, for instance, was attended by William Morris, as well as by Oscar 
Wilde, and it led directly to Walker’s informal partnership in Morris’s 
Kelmscott Press.) Wilde’s five reviews made it clear that he had attended 
closely to such luminaries of design as Walker, William Morris, T. J. Cobden-
Sanderson, and Walter Crane; and in his review of Crane’s closing lecture Wilde 
had enthusiastically endorsed Crane’s elevation of design over representational 
art on the grounds of its “ideal beauty,” its “loveliness” and its subordination 
of “appearance” to “decorative motive” (“The Close of the Arts and Crafts,” 106-
7).<footnote id="id13946793">For Wilde’s evolving response to T. J. Cobden-
Sanderson’s lecture on bookbinding, see Frankel, <emphasis effect="italics">Oscar Wilde’s Decorated Books</emphasis>, 114-
16.</footnote></para>
    <para id="id14388084">As important, in 1890 Wilde had written the following: 
</para>
    <para id="id14919856"><quote id="id14919856_quote" display="block">The art 
that is frankly 
decorative is the art to live with.... The marvels of design stir the 
imagination. In the mere loveliness of the materials employed there are latent 
elements of culture. Nor is this all. By its deliberate rejection of Nature as 
the ideal of beauty, as well as of the imitative method of the ordinary painter, 
decorative art not merely prepares the soul for the reception of true 
imaginative work, but develops in it that sense of form which is the basis of 
creative no less than of critical achievement. <emphasis effect="normal">(“The 
Critic As Artist,” 
398)</emphasis></quote>
    </para>
    <para id="id14001253">In the light of such ideas, it is perhaps not 
surprising that all of Wilde’s previous books had incorporated significant 
design elements; and Ricketts had played a central role personally in no less 
than five of them,<footnote id="id14018702">See Frankel, <emphasis effect="italics">Oscar Wilde’s Decorated Books</emphasis>; also Frankel, 
<emphasis effect="italics">Masking The Text</emphasis>, 191-221.</footnote> 
beginning with the book edition of <emphasis effect="italics">The Picture of 
Dorian Gray</emphasis> in 1891, while also contributing designs and page 
ornaments to <emphasis effect="italics">The Woman’s World</emphasis> during 
Wilde’s tenure as the magazine’s editor (1887-1889). By late 1891, Wilde proudly 
declared Ricketts to be “the subtle and fantastic decorator” of his books 
(<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 501) and there can be 
little doubt that the seriousness given to arrangements for the design and 
illustration of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> mattered as 
much to Wilde personally and intellectually as it did to Ricketts. </para>
    <para id="id13801855">In his publishing agreement with Mathews and Lane, 
Wilde also specified carefully how the book should be disseminated upon 
publication. As important as his already-quoted remark that he could sanction 
“no such thing as a popular or cheap edition” are Wilde’s initial refusal to 
countenance advertising of the book<footnote id="id15247724">In mid-June 1892, 
Wilde wrote to Mathews objecting to advertising of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> as “too indefinite” and “not…practical” 
(<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 527). That advertising 
costs were expressly limited—“not to exceed £5.5.0”—in the eventual contract 
(Nelson, 96) was almost certainly due to Wilde personally. </footnote> and his 
comment to his publishers that “a book of this kind—very rare and curious—must 
not be thrown into the gutter of English journalism…. I hope that the book will 
be subscribed for before publication, and that as few as possible will be sent 
for review” (<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 533). Such 
remarks are crucial not because of Wilde’s elitism but because of a certain 
resistance to appropriation, a façade or cool indifference, that is built into 
the work at the level of meaning, and which it famously shares with its 
enigmatic subject, the sphinx. As one reviewer quickly perceived at the time, 
the poem was “born rare” and “destined—at least in its original form—to become 
rarer still” (“Mr. Oscar Wilde and Edgar Poe,” n.p.) Certainly Wilde was fearful 
of the intellectual damage that “ordinary English newspapers” (<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 533) could do to his work. The 
scorn with which <emphasis effect="italics">The Picture of Dorian 
Gray</emphasis> and Bernhardt’s banned production of <emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis> had been met in the British press bore out 
this fear, just as the journalistic reception of the first English edition of 
<emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Yellow Book</emphasis>, and indeed <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Sphinx</emphasis> itself (see “Critical Reception” below) were to do. And it is 
certainly true that, from a strictly commercial viewpoint, “the author did 
everything he could to undermine” publication of <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Sphinx</emphasis> (Stetz and Lasner, <emphasis effect="italics">England in the 
1890s</emphasis>, 13). But a certain detachment from the circulation process was 
essential if the book was wholly to incarnate the central conceit of Wilde’s 
poem, which is on one level at least about the unattainability of positive 
knowledge, the history of art’s neglect, and the almost hieroglyphic 
indecipherability of art’s apparent meanings. If <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Sphinx</emphasis> aspired to the archaeological condition of a monolithic 
“sphinx,” in all its enigmatic beauty and unknowability, it was crucial, as 
Wilde remarked to a correspondent about another of his books, that it reach only 
“a small and quite unimportant sect of perfect people” (<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 526-27). His initial idea, in 
fact, was to publish an edition of just three copies, Wilde quipped: “one for 
myself, one for the British Museum, and one for Heaven. I had some doubts about 
the British Museum” (quoted Ellmann, 421). </para>
    <para id="id14313675">In Wilde’s remarks to his publishers about the poem’s 
reception, we can detect the emergence of an <emphasis effect="italics">avant-
garde</emphasis> sensibility that would become commonplace among Modernist 
writers and contributors to the little magazines in the twentieth century. This 
sensibility goes back in the nineteenth century at least as far as the 1840s, to 
the Pre-Raphaelites’ concern for the “Brotherhood” of art and poetry, if not 
also to William Blake’s scornful rejection of commercial print media at the turn 
of the nineteenth century. (Blake combined within himself the roles of poet, 
artist, printer, and publisher; and he embraced painstaking printing methods 
that ensured his works were issued, with virtually no publicity, only in 
extremely limited numbers or even single copies.) But if, like these earlier 
figures, Wilde felt that books are “delicate and most sensitive things, and if 
they are books worth reading, [they have] a strong dislike of the public” 
(<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 527), he was 
nonetheless fearful of the reaction with which <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Sphinx</emphasis> would be met. “No book of mine…ever goes to the <emphasis effect="italics">National Observer</emphasis>” (edited by W. E. Henley), Wilde 
specified; “I wrote to Henley to tell him so two years ago. He is too coarse, 
too offensive, too personal…. The <emphasis effect="italics">St. James 
Gazette</emphasis>, again, I would not 
have a copy sent to. They are most scurrilous” (<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 533). Although Wilde had begun 
composing <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> long before he ever 
put pen to paper to compose <emphasis effect="italics">The Picture of Dorian 
Gray</emphasis> in late 1889, the scandalized reception of his novel in 1890 
hangs like a shadow over arrangements for the publication of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>. Wilde was clearly conscious of the 
destructive effect English newspaper reviews had had upon <emphasis effect="italics">Dorian Gray</emphasis> two years earlier,<footnote id="id15240821">See especially the scathing review of <emphasis effect="italics">Dorian Gray</emphasis> in the <emphasis effect="italics">St. 
James Gazette</emphasis>, dated 20 June 1890 (rpt. in Beckson, 67-71), as well 
as another by one of W.E. Henley’s minions in the <emphasis effect="italics">Scots Observer</emphasis> (edited by Henley), dated 5 July 1890 
(rpt in Beckson, 74-75). These reviews, alongside other disparagements of 
<emphasis effect="italics">Dorian Gray</emphasis>, were republished in Millard, 
<emphasis effect="italics">Art and Morality</emphasis>. </footnote> and he 
clearly predicted the scurrilous review of <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Sphinx</emphasis> that Henley would compose (and print unsigned) in the 
<emphasis effect="italics">Pall Mall Gazette</emphasis> in July 1894. For these 
reasons, Wilde is reported to have said that he “hesitated to publish <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> as it would destroy domesticity in 
England” (quoted in “The City of Books,” 165-66; also in Millard, 399). </para>
    <para id="id7619228">In the event, of course, the reverse proved to be the 
case. Far from destroying domesticity in England, <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Sphinx</emphasis> blazed scandalously but briefly across English and Bostonian 
skies in the summer of 1894 only to fall into a long period of comparative 
neglect. This neglect was due in part to the disgrace brought upon Wilde’s work 
and upon aestheticism generally, in the eyes of many, by Wilde’s imprisonment 
for “gross indecency” in the spring of 1895. For it was Wilde himself who ended 
up destroyed by English domesticity, an impoverished, nearly broken, man 
following his release in 1897 from a two-year gaol sentence for sexual 
“offences” that are now legal in most parts of the English-speaking world and 
that are perhaps obscurely hinted at in the perverse imaginings of his greatest 
poem. Probably for this reason, many accolades have been awarded in the past 112 
years to Wilde’s oft-anthologized and mournful poem <emphasis effect="italics">The Ballad of Reading Gaol</emphasis>, composed in the 
immediate aftermath of his prison experiences, a poem that went into numerous 
editions even before Wilde’s death in 1900. But the poem that dominated Wilde’s 
creative mind in the years running up to his imprisonment, and that in some ways 
best embodies the Decadent Movement as a whole, is <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>. Its republication in the form that Wilde 
personally countenanced is long overdue.</para>

      <title>The Origins of The Sphinx</title>
      <para id="id11231776">The precise origins of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> are clouded in myth. While scholars 
generally agree that Wilde finished writing the poem in 1893, one year after 
contracting to publish it and one year prior to its eventual publication, there 
is considerable disagreement about when he began composing it. Many scholars now 
accept the view, first advanced in 1907 by Wilde’s bibliographer Christopher 
Millard (who published under the pseudonym “Stuart Mason”) and reiterated by him 
in 1914 (“Mason,” <emphasis effect="italics">Bibliography</emphasis>, 398), that 
the poem was begun while Wilde was a student at Oxford, before his graduation in 
1878. The evidence upon which Millard based this view was twofold: the existence 
of a manuscript draft of lines 141-3 incorporating a cartoon by Wilde of a 
gowned academic; and the fact that lines 17-18 of the poem, <emphasis effect="smallcaps">“While i have hardly 
seen/ some twenty summers cast their green in autumn’s gaudy 
liveries,”</emphasis> recur in 
Wilde’s Newdigate Prize-winning poem <emphasis effect="italics">Ravenna</emphasis>, which he had read aloud at Oxford’s 
Sheldonian Theater in June 1878, nearly three months after submitting it to the 
Prize committee. For Millard, the fact that <emphasis effect="italics">Ravenna</emphasis> contains no other instances of lines 
recurring in poems of indisputably later date is evidence that Wilde began 
composing <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> before <emphasis effect="italics">Ravenna</emphasis>. Millard’s evidence, it will be observed, is 
conjectural and thin—Wilde was a frequent visitor to Oxford in the late 1870s 
and early 1880s, so the cartoon could easily postdate his undergraduate years. 
But it has been endorsed by many scholars, including the poem’s most recent 
editors, Bobby Fong and Karl Beckson, who write “that the poem was begun during 
Wilde’s Oxford years can be inferred from a MS draft of lines 141-3, which also 
contains a cartoon sketch of a gowned professor” (Fong and Beckson, 305-6). Fong 
and Beckson also date to Wilde’s Oxford years the earliest surviving fair copy 
of the poem, written in Wilde’s hand on three folio sheets containing early 
versions of lines 1-44 and 73-106, as well as eleven pages of fragmentary 
jottings that correspond closely to lines contained in the fair copy. 
Significantly, Fong and Beckson make no claims about dating based upon the line 
shared with <emphasis effect="italics">Ravenna</emphasis>, writing only that 
<emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> “echoes” the earlier poem (Fong 
and Beckson, 307). </para>
      <para id="id10422937">Wilde’s executor and friend Robert Ross muddied the 
waters further in 1910 when he declared, in a prefatory Note to a new printing 
of the poem (without Ricketts’s decorations), that Wilde had told him that 
<emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> had been commenced during a 
trip to Paris in 1874 but that he (Ross) could not help thinking that Wilde’s 
account of the poem’s origins was a “poetical licence” (Ross, vii). Wilde is 
known to have visited Paris in 1874, and this dating, which predates Wilde’s 
Oxford years, has been accepted—though with some skepticism—by Wilde’s 
preeminent biographer, Richard Ellmann.</para>
      <para id="id8627298">But if scholars are uncertain about the precise date 
Wilde began composing <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>, there is 
widespread agreement that much of the poem was composed shortly after Wilde’s 
yearlong lecture-tour of America had ended, during an extended visit Wilde made 
to Paris from January to April 1883. It is significant that Wilde turned to the 
poem so swiftly once his tour commitments were over, and significant too that 
much of the poem was composed in Paris. Egypt’s Great Sphinx of Giza had 
preoccupied many French artists and poets ever since Napoleon’s invasion of 
Egypt (1798-1801), and Charles Baudelaire and Théophile Gautier, the two French 
poets most beloved by Wilde, had both written important sphinx poems. In the 
third of his “Spleen” poems, for instance, Baudelaire had written:</para>

      </para>
      <para id="id9069549">While in Paris, Wilde formed a close friendship with 
the journalist Robert Harborough Sherard, the grandson of William Wordsworth, 
who would go on to become Wilde’s first biographer. Much of their conversation 
turned on the work of Baudelaire, Gautier, de Nerval, and Poe (Ellmann, 218)—and 
indeed the influence of all four writers can be traced in <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>, whose particular debts to Poe’s “The 
Raven,” as well as to the two poems titled “The Cat” in Baudelaire’s <emphasis effect="italics">Flowers of Evil</emphasis>, have frequently been remarked by 
critics. In <emphasis effect="italics">Oscar Wilde: The Story of An Unhappy 
Friendship</emphasis> (1902), Sherard wrote memorably that he personally 
witnessed Wilde putting the finishing touches to his verse drama <emphasis effect="italics">The Duchess of Padua</emphasis> in the spring of 1883, as well 
as “those two wonderful poems ‘The Harlot’s House’ and ‘The Sphynx’”:</para>
      <para id="id17261317"><quote id="id17261317_quote" display="block">I was 
with him all the time 
that they were being elaborated. I heard him fashion the lines, often repeating, 
as we walked abroad, passages that had pleased him in their writing…. I remember 
that for “The Sphynx” he asked me for a 
rhyme in '-ar' for a lagging verse. I 
can recall the accent with which he often repeated this request, and chid me 
with the question “Why have you brought me no rhyme from Passy ?”… On the day 
when I found 'nenuphar' for the wanting rhyme, I was made as proud by his thanks 
as though I had achieved great things in literature. We may have been precious 
and ridiculous, but…neither for him nor for me was there anything outside of 
literature. <emphasis effect="normal">(Sherard, 31-32)</emphasis></quote>
      </para>
      <para id="id12081025">In a letter from early April 1883 that demonstrates 
the intensity of the two men’s shared concern for poetics, Wilde commended to 
Sherard the “Envoi” he had written the previous year, for a volume of poetry by 
his one-time friend Rennell Rodd, with the words “The rhythmical value of prose 
has never yet been fully tested. I hope to do some more work in that genre, as 
soon as I have sung my Sphinx to sleep, and found a trisyllabic rhyme for 
‘catafalque’” (<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 205-6). 
Wilde considered Sherard a fellow poet and aesthete, though there were clearly 
bonds of love between the two men as well. But at the end of April Wilde 
returned to London, from where he confessed to Sherard two months later “Not 
that I have written here—the splendid whirl and swirl of life in London sweeps 
me from my Sphinx…. I wish I were back in Paris, where I did such good work” 
(<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 211). By this time, 
Wilde had produced a second fair-copy draft of the poem, written on quarto sheets, representing “a substantially completed version of the poem” 
(Fong and Beckson, 306) including thirteen stanzas later omitted from the first 
published text.</para>
      <para id="id11216939"> Wilde appears to have been “swept” from his sphinx 
for at least the next six years. According to Robert Ross, “the poem was 
polished and improved in 1889, after [Wilde] unearthed the MS. from an old 
despatch box at Tite Street in my presence” (Ross, vii). At some point after 
1891, Wilde dedicated the poem to the French Symbolist poet Marcel Schwob, a 
fact that tempts one to associate the poem’s composition with <emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis>, written in Paris in fall 1891. Schwob was a 
continual presence in Wilde’s life during the composition of <emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis>, and he is known to have corrected proofs of 
the play late in 1892, prior to its publication in French in February 1893. And 
certainly, as we have seen, <emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis> was 
much on Wilde’s mind when he contracted with Mathews and Lane for publication of 
<emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>. But Ellmann conjectures that 
Wilde dedicated <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx </emphasis>to Schwob 
largely in thanks for his help in proofing and correcting the French <emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis>, and perhaps also in thanks for Schwob’s 
earlier dedication of his story “le Pays bleu” to Wilde in 1892 (Ellmann, 346 
and 374), and no evidence has ever surfaced to suggest that Wilde took up 
<emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> between 1889 and summer 1892. 
</para>
      <para id="id13361506"> But in summer 1892, as we have already seen, plans 
for publishing the poem with decorations by Ricketts were already well advanced. 
In the same letter in which he returned the signed publishing agreement for 
<emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>, Wilde asked John Lane to “have 
a type-written copy made for me, so that I can correct the text before Ricketts 
writes it out” (<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 534). 
Wilde frequently made arrangements for his manuscripts to be typewritten around 
this time (see Frankel, <emphasis effect="italics">Masking the Text</emphasis>, 
83-100) and the typescript of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> 
that Wilde requested survives today with Wilde’s handwritten corrections on it. 
Shortly prior to this, Wilde had written out a fair copy draft of the entire 
poem, as it then existed, shorn of the thirteen additional stanzas composed in 
Paris in 1883. This draft survives, along with accompanying sketches revealing 
Ricketts’s first ideas for visualizing the poem. Crucially, both these surviving 
texts from 1892 present the poem in couplets, the two-line stanza form in which 
it was eventually printed, whereas all previous drafts had been written out in 
quatrains, or four-line stanzas, reminiscent technically of Tennyson’s so-called 
“<emphasis effect="italics">In Memoriam</emphasis> stanza.” This “stretching” of 
the Tennysonian stanza was understood in 1894 by one reviewer as “proof… of the 
cynical humour which distinguishes Mr. Wilde” (“Unsigned Review,” 170). But it 
is an important, in-built indicator of Wilde’s intentions for publishing the 
poem—for the poem to be <emphasis effect="italics">seen</emphasis>—and, as 
Henley perceived, it was almost certainly dictated by Wilde’s and Ricketts’s 
imagining of how the poem would appear on the printed page, as well as their 
“aesthetic” concern with foregrounding the poem’s artistry. As Henley was to 
write, “the couplets…are really quatrains, as the staves of <emphasis effect="italics">In Memoriam</emphasis>, but by a special stroke of art they are 
printed as something else” (Henley, 168).</para>
      <para id="id7377062"> Although Wilde’s poem was essentially complete in 
the summer of 1892, it still lacked three features crucial to publication. We 
have already seen that—as with all of Wilde’s recent books—Ricketts’s visual 
designs were integral to Wilde’s own concept of the poem at the moment of 
publication. Ricketts labored over his designs in fall 1892/winter 1893, 
painstakingly producing a series of studies and finished drawings in pen and ink 
for the covers, title page, and illustrations, as well as the series of 
illuminated capitals that is such a conspicuous feature of the resulting book. 
With the exception of those for the cover designs, Ricketts’s drawings would be 
reproduced photomechanically, by line-blocking or “process” printing, in the 
printed book, though Ricketts’s original drawings “have an even greater nervous 
quality of line than the process blocks” (Calloway, 16), owing to subtle changes 
introduced by the exigencies of photomechanical printing. Ricketts began this 
work in June 1892 (Delaney, 82); according to his contract with Mathews and 
Lane, it was to be completed by October 1, 1892, and Ricketts was to be paid a 
total of £45 in monthly installments beginning on July 18. Two of Ricketts’s 
drawings were published separately from Wilde’s poem in 1893, within months of 
Ricketts completing them.<footnote id="id6334796">Ricketts’s pen and ink drawing 
of the crucifixion, printed as an illustration to the closing lines of the poem 
in the 1894 text, was published separately in 1893, untitled and uncaptioned, in 
the Dutch avant-garde magazine, <emphasis effect="italics">Van Nu en 
Straks</emphasis>, 5 (1893), interleaved between pages 30 and 31; and the 
drawing eventually printed in the 1894 text illustrating “the labyrinth in which 
the twy-formed bull was stalled” was published in October 1893 in <emphasis effect="italics">The Dial</emphasis>, no. 3, under the title “’In The Thebiad’: 
An Illustration to A Poem By Oscar Wilde To Be Published at the Sign of the 
Bodley Head.” </footnote> Ricketts later gave the following memorable account of 
his intentions in producing these pictures:</para>
      <para id="id7339604">
        <quote id="id7339604_quote" display="block">In the pictures I have 
striven to combine, consciously or unconsciously, those affinities in line work 
broadcast in all epochs. My attempt there as elsewhere was to evolve what one 
might imagine as possible in one charmed moment or place, just as some great 
Italian masters painted as they thought in the antique manner, studying like 
Piero della Francesca, for instance, to fulfill the conditions laid down by 
Apelles, whom he had of course never seen, but had taken on trust<emphasis effect="normal"> (Ricketts, A 
	Defence, 25).</emphasis></quote>
      </para>
      <para id="id10402419">But although Ricketts always regarded his pictures 
for <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> as the best of all his 
illustrations, to the extent that later in life he produced a second unpublished 
series along similar lines, Wilde was disapproving, remarking cattily, “No, my 
dear Ricketts, your drawings are not of your best. You have seen them through 
your intellect, not your temperament” (quoted in Ricketts, <emphasis effect="italics">Oscar Wilde: Recollections</emphasis>, 38).<footnote id="id15749077">Corbett sees this remark as paradigmatic of the personal 
tensions between writer and artist, nearly always present in the creation of 
even the most successful literary illustrations (Corbett, 36). Paradoxically, 
Wilde required the visual artistry of Ricketts and Beardsley—and before them, of 
Whistler—even as he privately disparaged these men or their work. 
</footnote></para>
      <para id="id10138660">The second crucial feature introduced between 1892 
and 1894 derives from Ricketts’s decision to print the entire poem, save for the 
wood-blocked initial letters of the 1894 edition, in roman capitals. Like the 
decision to print a familiar stanza form in couplet form, this decision not only 
adds to the air of estrangement and artifice by “defamiliarizing” Wilde’s 
language itself, but also turns each line into an iconic or monumental thing not 
unlike the sphinx itself. (Roman capitals, sometimes called “inscriptional 
capitals,” are so-called because of their survival on notable Roman monuments, 
such as Trajan’s Column in Rome, where their letter-forms inspired printers and 
typographers in the fifteenth century to invent “old” or “roman-face” 
typeforms.) As Ricketts himself later justified this decision, “I made an 
effort…towards a book marked by surviving classical traits, printing it in 
Capitals” (Ricketts, <emphasis effect="italics">A Defence</emphasis>, 25). 
</para>
      <para id="id6523219">By February 1893, the designs and text had evidently 
been submitted for printing, since Wilde wrote to Lane at this date eager “to 
hear how <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> is progressing, and 
what date it is likely to come out on” (<emphasis effect="italics">Complete 
Letters</emphasis>, 545). (Four months later, Wilde referred to himself 
confidently, in a telegram to Ada Leverson, as “the author of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>” [<emphasis effect="italics">Complete 
Letters</emphasis>, 568].) But upon returning corrected proofs to Ricketts, 
Wilde remarked, “Don’t you think the pages are terribly few in number ? Why not 
put fewer verses on each page ? We could easily have four or five pages more” 
(<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 591).<footnote id="id7480932">Holland and Hart-Davis, the editors of Wilde's correspondence, 
date this (undated) letter "Spring 1894." I follow Isobel Murray ("Some 
Problems," 73) in regarding Spring 1893 as a more likely date.</footnote> And in 
a letter speculatively dated June 1893 by its recent editors, Wilde expressed a 
sudden concern to “make the whole poem longer” at the proof stages: “I return 
proof of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>,” he wrote to 
Ricketts: “Will you kindly have a corrected proof copy sent to me, as I want to 
see if I could make the whole poem longer. I do not know the name of the 
printers, or I would write to them direct” (<emphasis effect="italics">Complete 
Letters</emphasis>, 566). Shortly after this, Wilde composed and inserted lines 
75-88 (<emphasis effect="smallcaps">“The river horses in the slime…. his marble 
limbs made pale the moon and 
lent the day a larger light”</emphasis>), arguably the most erotic and decadent 
lines in 
the poem. The incorporation of these lines represents the third and final change 
made after 1892, Wilde having first drafted these lines in fragmentary form in a 
notebook that survives to this date (see Fong and Beckson, 306-7). </para>

      <title>Critical Reception of The Sphinx</title>
      <para id="id6849366">As already observed, publication of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> was held up for the best part of a year, 
in part because of the attention given by Mathews and Lane to <emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">The Yellow 
Book</emphasis>, but perhaps also because of some reticence on the part of the 
publishers as well as by Ricketts’s efforts, whilst engaged on <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>, to illustrate, print, and privately 
publish an edition of <emphasis effect="italics">Hero and 
Leander</emphasis>, by Christopher Marlowe and George Chapman. When the book was eventually published in June 
1894,<footnote id="id16069042"><emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> 
appeared on either 8 June 1894 (Nelson <emphasis effect="italics">The Early 
Nineties</emphasis>, 322; <emphasis effect="italics">A Checklist</emphasis>, 59) 
or 11 June 1894 (Mason, <emphasis effect="italics">Bibliography</emphasis>, 394) 
as a large octavo, measuring 8 ½ inches by 6 ¾ inches, printed on unbleached 
laid paper watermarked “Unbleached Arnold,” priced at two guineas. Fifty copies 
were exported to Copeland and Day for sale in America (Nelson, <emphasis effect="italics">The Early Nineties</emphasis>, 311 and 322). According to 
Mason, “The agents for the book in America, Messrs. Copeland and Day, of Boston, 
having drawn the attention of the London publishers to the fact that <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx </emphasis>did not bear the imprint of the Boston 
firm, a special label was designed by Charles Ricketts for insertion in the 
copies for sale in the United States of America” (<emphasis effect="italics">Bibliography</emphasis>, 394). Later in the year, an additional 
twenty-five large-paper copies were issued, measuring 10 inches by 7 ½ inches, 
printed on handmade paper watermarked “Unbleached Arnold (Ruskin),” with 
Copeland and Day’s imprint appearing alongside Mathews and Lane’s on the title 
page. These were priced at five guineas in England and thirty dollars in 
America. Owing to the larger format, Ricketts’s cover designs were extended 
vertically by approximately one inch for the large-paper issue. It is not known 
how many of the large-paper copies were exported to America. There exists some 
uncertainty about the size of the edition where the small-paper copies are 
concerned. The book’s statement of limitation states merely, “the edition of 
this book is limited for England to 200 copies,” and Mason too mentions this 
figure (though he underestimates the number of small-paper copies shipped to 
America when he writes “besides the 200 copies for sale in England, fifty 
additional copies were printed for the Press and for sale in America” [<emphasis effect="italics">Bibliography</emphasis>, 394]). The publisher’s announcement of 
August 1894 (see Mason, <emphasis effect="italics">Bibliography</emphasis>, 394) 
states “250 copies.” It was common practice, then as now, to hold back some 
copies for the author’s and publishers’ private use, and though the number of 
such copies cannot now be determined with accuracy, eight presentation copies 
are known to exist inscribed with Wilde’s signature. Intriguingly, the Bodley 
Head’s stock inventory of 30 June 1894 (Nelson <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Early Nineties</emphasis>, 322) lists a print run of 303 small-paper copies, as 
well as domestic sales of just 81 copies prior to the end of June, with another 
128 copies standing unbound in quires. Clearly the book was not “subscribed for 
before publication,” as Wilde had hoped when agreeing to publishing terms 
(<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 533), and almost as 
certainly a large number of copies remained unsold by the time of Wilde’s 
imprisonment, only to be accidentally destroyed in a fire at the Ballantyne 
Press in 1899 “with the result that <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Sphinx</emphasis> is not only the most splendid of Ricketts’s early books, but 
also the rarest” (Calloway, 16).</footnote> copies did fall into the “gutter” of 
English journalism, despite Wilde’s own wishes, where the book met with 
generally hostile—though not unperceptive—reactions. After making the already-
quoted remark about the “cynical humour” to be found in Wilde’s “writing such a 
poem…in the meter of <emphasis effect="italics">In Memoriam</emphasis>,” 
<emphasis effect="italics">The Athenaeum</emphasis> commented only that 
“admirers of some of Oscar Wilde’s previously published poems…will not welcome 
this poem” (“Unsigned Review,” 171). The poem’s gorgeousness of diction 
disguised a “poverty of motive,” remarked the <emphasis effect="italics">Athenaeum</emphasis>’s anonymous reviewer; and while the poem’s 
meter was “handled” with “skilfulness,” and its lines possessed an “easy flow 
and sonorousness,” the poem showed obvious defects such as “the too frequent use 
of the word `paramour’ or the employment of ‘curious’ in a somewhat precious 
sense” (“Unsigned Review,” 171). The <emphasis effect="italics">Pall Mall 
Budget</emphasis> was more biting: “the keen olfactory nerves of the 
Nonconformist conscience would not…find it difficult” to “scent” the “meaning 
underlying Mr. Wilde’s poem,” remarked the <emphasis effect="italics">Budget</emphasis>’s anonymous reviewer (“The City of Books,” 
164-65), implying by this elliptical remark that the “meaning underlying” 
Wilde’s poem was decadent, presumably sexual, and offensive to conventional 
taste. Or again, “it will be interesting to watch the effect of this poem on the 
eminently respectable newspapers” (“The City of Books,” 166). But despite these 
strictures, the <emphasis effect="italics">Budget</emphasis>’s reviewer went on, 
the poem’s “motive is mainly important as affording Mr. Wilde a theme for the 
display, in a sort of processional, of beautiful words strangely shaped and 
coloured” (“The City of Books,” 165). Meaning was a secondary consideration to 
the poem’s “beautiful sound”: “How many of us, I wonder, know the nature of 
'rods of oreichalch’ [or of ]… 'samite’?” (“The City of Books,” 164). For the 
<emphasis effect="italics">Pall Mall Budget</emphasis>, the unintelligibility of 
Wilde’s language “serves…all the more to give that sense of mysterious luxury at 
which Mr. Wilde is aiming” (“The City of Books,” 164).</para>

shedding of a waistcoat and “gaskins,” to the minor poet’s fondness for 
Piccadilly, to the predilection for affectionate diminutive names, and to the 
need for police to maintain public order:</para>

be remarked is not 
to live; and we are all Strug-for-Lifers now. If Hughie went forth without his 
coat, and walked in Piccadilly, Ernie would take off his waistcoat, and do 
likewise; and Bobbie and Freddie would each of them go one better than Ernie; 
till in due course the police must interfere. It is thus with the New Style, or 
Fin-de-Siècle, Minor Poet. His ancestors were modest – after their kind; they 
wrote and printed, being to the manner born, but all the while they knew that in 
the end the Twopenny Box was theirs until crack of doom. Their latest-born is of 
less abject mould. He may despair of being read; but he will be remarked, or he 
will die. So he goes forth into the world, year after year, as MM Ernie and Co., 
into 'Piccadilly, that immortal street,’ still shedding something – some rag of 
style, or sentiment, or decent manners – as he goes; and in the end one looks to 
see him without his gaskins (so to speak)…. Not yet, we haste to add, is this 
the fortune of the learned and enterprising author of <emphasis effect="normal">The Sphinx</emphasis>. He has 
discarded certain lendings, it is true; but he has retained enough for Mrs.

deliberately frantic, its hues are of so purposeful a violence, that his end is 
gained, and immediate conspicuousness assured. To put his case in a figure: You

fleshings of mauve, and a yellow turn, an antic thing, whose first effect is 
that of a very bedlamitish bookie. You approach the creature with a view to 
business – when lo! you are aware that it is only Mr. Wilde’s latest avatar, 
after all. Then you note that he is trading in a novel sort of fancy goods.

      <para id="id5793520">Henley implies here that Wilde flaunts his sexuality 
through the very physique of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>, 
despite retaining “enough for Mrs. Grundy and the suburbs.”<footnote id="id7341767">Mrs. Grundy, a character in Thomas Morton's play <emphasis effect="italics">Speed the Plough</emphasis> (1798), was by the mid-nineteenth 
century widely considered a personification of prudery and conventional 
propriety. </footnote> But Henley’s judgments here are colored not merely by 
barely concealed homophobia: for by figuring Wilde’s “case” as that of the 
“bookie” or “fancy goods” trader, Henley also exposes Wilde’s artistic 
pretensions to the harsh light of “business,” reducing a work over which Wilde 
and Ricketts had labored for years to a carefully calculated, even crude, work 
of commerce. This was precisely the kind of reaction that Wilde had feared from 
the British press, and to a writer eager to be taken as a poet, not merely an 
author (to invoke the distinction made by Wilde in signing his contract), it 
must have been especially disturbing. But in truth Henley’s review exposes fault 
lines at the heart not merely of Wilde’s work but of aesthetic art and writing 
generally; for as the critic Jonathan Freedman has observed, aesthetes such as 
Wilde and Henry James participated in a market economy, particularly in “the 
commodification of art and literature wrought by such an economy,” even as they 
critiqued or refused it through what Freedman terms their “professionalization 
of literary and artistic practice” (Freedman, xii). By some lights, <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> seemed nothing more than a carefully-
packaged commodity, designed to yield the maximum profit for its author and 
publishers, even as it obscured its own commodity status behind the language of 
art, decoration, and poetry.<footnote id="id14299465">Henley’s point was 
underscored a few months later by a short notice of the large-paper issue which 
appeared, under the byline “Mr. Wilde’s `Expensive Book,’” in the American 
periodical <emphasis effect="italics">Munsey’s Magazine</emphasis>: “While 
almost everybody is crying for cheap books, Mr. Oscar Wilde is sending out a 
lament that it is impossible to buy an expensive book any more. So he has 
written one. It is called ‘The Sphinx,’ and it is a poem. Twenty five copies 
only have been printed, and they are sold, or are to be sold, for thirty dollars 
apiece. The book is illustrated by Mr. Charles Ricketts, and is, as a matter of 
course, an ideal book from the printer's point of view.” After giving “a sample 
of Mr. Wilde's idea of an ‘expensive’ poem,” <emphasis effect="italics">Munsey’s</emphasis> commented only “if anybody wants to give 
Mr. Wilde thirty dollars, this is an opportunity to do so. He is taking up a 
collection for current expenses” (“Oscar Wilde’s ‘Expensive Book,’” <emphasis effect="italics">Munsey’s Magazine</emphasis>, Feb. 1895 [12:5], 551). <emphasis effect="italics">Munsey’s</emphasis> was one of very few notices of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> to appear in America in Wilde’s lifetime.

in this respect is that of Gleeson White, one-time editor of <emphasis effect="italics">The Studio</emphasis>, and later (before his early death in 
1898), an important spokesman for illustration as an art form in its own right.

important essay-length study of Ricketts’s work in which he paved the way for 
twentieth-century appreciations of Ricketts as one of the most important 
designers of the <emphasis effect="italics">fin de siècle</emphasis>. Here White 
treated Ricketts’s visual designs for <emphasis effect="italics">The

total book, not any the less expressive of “imagination” and “artistry” for 
Ricketts’s self-conscious concern to adhere to decorative or “conventional”

an age of tremendous parodies and caricatures, and one of the best practitioners 
in this respect was Wilde’s friend the satirist Ada Leverson, whom Wilde dubbed 
“the Sphinx” in 1892 or 1893 (he first met her in 1892 and was immediately drawn 
to her wit, intellect, and great personal kindness).<footnote id="id15085372">See esp. Wilde’s telegram to Leverson of June 1893: “The author

      <para id="id12783635">A number of features of this parody are remarkable. 
First by casting the poem in the language of present-day journalism, and by 
characterizing the “Sphinx” as a sexually uninhibited woman of the present day, 
Leverson squarely emphasizes femininity and female sexuality while defusing 
their outrageousness as it is implied by Wilde’s own characterizations of the 
sphinx. Where Wilde (or at least the speaker of his poem)<footnote id="id14600471">We would be mistaken if we conflated Wilde with the speaker of 
his poem, since Wilde goes to considerable lengths to characterize the speaker 
of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> as an ingenuous young man of 
extremely limited experience, ruled by his imagination, given to excessive and 
ungrounded speculative fantasy. Formally, Wilde’s poem is a dramatic monologue 
or “monodrama,” and by the end of the poem the speaker’s characterizations of 
femininity are shown up to be as outrageous and unreliable as any other aspect 
of his characterizations of the sphinx and of ancient history. </footnote> 
characterizes the sphinx as an “<emphasis effect="smallcaps">exquisite
grotesque! Half woman and half animal!</emphasis>” and as a “<emphasis effect="smallcaps">loathsome mystery</emphasis>” whose “<emphasis effect="smallcaps">pulse makes poisonous melodies” and 
who “wake[s] foul dreams of sensual life</emphasis>,” Leverson returns the 
sphinx to a 
world of familiar, even tame, heterosexual femininity and prosaic, if faintly 
flirtatious, conversation. As Margaret Debelius remarks in a valuable essay-
length study of Leverson’s parodies, “by defusing the threat of the femme fatale 
in Wilde’s poem, Leverson revised the role of sphinx to suggest that femininity 
is much less strange and dangerous than decadent poets imagine” (Debelius, 203). 
This accentuating of a distinctly unthreatening and modern heterosexual 
femininity is accomplished too by Leverson’s reversal of the unspoken gender 
rules structuring the celebrity interview of Wilde’s and Leverson’s own day. In 
the 1890s such interviews typically paid homage to powerful male writers, 
politicians, and artists: Wilde himself had been the subject of several such 
interviews, and Leverson here seems conscious of the deference with which Wilde 
himself had been treated by star-struck interviewers. By offering that same 
deference to a female subject, Leverson reverses the conventions governing the 
celebrity interview so as to cast the “Poet” in the role of interviewer, while 
celebrating the power and authority of a distinctly female subject. But most 
important of all, by casting Wilde’s subject as “not a Sphinx” but a “Minx,” 
Leverson downplays the historical, poetic, or archaeological aspects of Wilde’s 
poem and accentuates an element of sexual seduction, suggesting “that Wilde’s 
poem…beneath its overblown syntax and labored rhymes, is really just an 
elaborate pick-up line” (Debelius, 203).<footnote id="id11816260">Debelius 
overstates her case by arguing (confusingly) that “Leverson countered Wilde’s 
counterdiscourse by unmasking him as a flirt: he is the sphinx/minx in pursuit 
of [Marcel] Schwob” (Debelius, 204). Debelius’s biographical reading here, of 
both “The Minx” and <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>, is 
grounded in the claim first made by Regenia Gagnier that <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> represents Wilde’s seduction of the 
symbolist poet Marcel Schwob and that “In writing the poem, Wilde the 
seducer/Sphinx confronted the reticent student/Schwob with Schwob's own thinly 
repressed desires" (Gagnier, 45). But Debelius accepts Gagnier’s assertion 
(which is itself based upon the unsupported claim that Wilde met Schwob in Paris 
in 1883) somewhat too easily. No evidence has ever surfaced suggesting that 
Wilde met Schwob before 1891, by which time Wilde’s poem was largely complete 
(though Schwob's biographer, Pierre Champion, writes that Wilde "avait été 
annoncé à Marcel Schwob par John Gray en 1892" [<emphasis effect="italics">Marcel Schwob et son temps</emphasis> (Paris, 1927), p. 98]). 
By 1891 Schwob was hardly the sixteen-year-old <emphasis effect="italics">ingénue</emphasis> Gagnier makes him out to be but an 
experienced <emphasis effect="italics">décadent</emphasis>. As I suggest above, 
following Ellmann, it is likely that Wilde dedicated <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> to Schwob in thanks for the work Schwob 
had done on <emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis>. </footnote></para>
      <para id="id14271140">It might easily be objected that this is to make too 
much of a comic bauble and that Leverson’s parody is not a “critical” response 
to <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> at all. After all, its tone 
is deliberately light-hearted—at the opposite extreme from Henley’s caustic 
sarcasm—and Leverson was among Wilde’s staunchest personal friends. (Leverson 
and her husband offered shelter to Wilde in 1895, when he was released on bail 
between his two trials for “gross indecency,” when no other home or hotel in 
London would open its doors to him. See Ellmann, 469-70). Significantly, Wilde 
himself was vastly amused by Leverson’s skit, perhaps seeing it as a form of 
tribute no less than critique: “<emphasis effect="italics">Punch</emphasis> is 
delightful and the drawing a masterpiece of clever caricature. I am afraid she 
really was a minx after all. You are the only Sphinx” (<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 593). But affection is a crucial 
element of parody; and scholars of parody (especially of parody by women) argue 
that such tendencies to love, affection, and gentleness as are displayed in Leverson's parody license rather than defuse its capacity for critique. As Wilde himself 
recognized, “Parody, which is the Muse with her tongue in her cheek, has always 
amused me; but it requires a light touch and a fanciful treatment and, oddly 
enough, a love of the poet whom it caricatures. One’s disciples can parody one—
nobody else” (<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 390). As 
Debelius states, “in Leverson’s case parody worked as a double-edged sword that 
allowed her both to express her great loyalty to Wilde and to use her great wit 
to distance herself from those aspects of aestheticism she found distasteful…. 
It is precisely through parody that Leverson defined herself as a writer 
sympathetic to aspects of aestheticism while still critiquing its masculinist 
politics…. Leverson loved Wilde enough to repeat him convincingly, but it was a 
repetition with a difference. And this difference carries the power of 
subversion” (Debelius, 193-96). </para>
      <para id="id14370275">Leverson’s 1894 parody, then, represents one of the 
most important critical responses to the poem in Wilde’s own lifetime, 
especially from the standpoint of gender, even if acknowledging its “importance” 
flies in the face of a triviality or wittiness that is as cultivated as that on 
display in Wilde’s own <emphasis effect="italics">The Importance of Being 
Earnest</emphasis>. But if Leverson’s parody holds obvious appeal today, it 
heralded no sudden growth in readership of Wilde’s poem, and <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> remained neglected and unread for many 
years into the twentieth century. There are many reasons for this neglect: 
Modernist writers such as Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis, and T. S. Eliot worked hard 
(and largely successfully) in the early decades of the twentieth century to 
denigrate the “aestheticism” of the 1890s; but even before this, Wilde’s work 
had been disgraced in the eyes of many readers by Wilde’s imprisonment for 
“gross indecency” in the spring of 1895. External causes were not wholly to 
blame, however; the poem’s neglect had to some extent been “willed” by the poem 
itself, or at least by its author and first publishers. The format of the 1894 
edition embodies the book’s “strong dislike of the public”; and as we have seen, 
Wilde was determined that it should reach only “a small and quite unimportant 
sect of perfect people.” Ricketts’s designs for <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Sphinx</emphasis> began to attract serious attention from art historians and 
print historians in the 1960s and 1970s, following a more general resurgence of 
interest in art nouveau, printmaking, and the arts of the book. But Wilde’s poem 
languished as an entity in its own right till the final decades of the twentieth 
century, when the rise in Wilde’s reputation, the growth of scholarship in book 
history, and increased scholarly attention to the “composite” nature or “textual 
condition” of literary works all conspired to bring fresh attention to 
it.<footnote id="id11714889">Important new editions of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> were produced prior to World War I in 
formats distinct from the first edition of 1894—notably the edition illustrated 
by “Alasdair” [Hans Henning von Voight], though this was not published by John 
Lane till 1920; and private presses occasionally printed very limited runs of 
the poem, accompanied by new illustrations in each case, in the 1950s and 1960s. 
Crucially, however, none of these editions generated critical comment or 
significant new readership for the poem.</footnote> At first, that attention was 
confined largely to the work of editors who had set out to present Wilde’s works 
generally to a larger academic readership. But the past two decades or so have 
seen a number of important critical studies of Wilde’s poem, in some of which 
the questions of gender raised into prominence by Leverson’s parody are taken 
up, in others of which Ricketts’s powerful decorations for the first edition of 
1894 are seen as important constituents of meaning. </para>

      <title>Excavating The Sphinx: Towards An Archaeological Poetics</title>
      <para id="id10322182">Henley was right to ask his readers to “conceive a 
largish quarto bound in white and gold…composed of some twenty leaves of fair, 
rough paper (many of them blank); ten designs…thirteen initials…all printed in a 
curious green; and eighty-five couplets…all printed in small caps.” For the 
matters that Henley enumerates force their attention upon readers of the 1894 
text even before reading has gotten under way. The cover design alone is a 
consummate work of art or design, as Gleeson White appreciated, and it bears the 
monogram of both Charles Ricketts, its designer, and Leighton, Son, and Hodge, 
the book’s binder. In gilt stamped onto white vellum boards, Ricketts’s 
“remarkably spare architectural composition” contains both representational 
elements, suggested by the poem directly, as well as more decorative elements 
that “tease the viewer in the same way that the enigmatic sphinx within 
fascinates and mystifies the poet” (Brooks, 312). In some ways, Ricketts’s 
binding is reminiscent of those bindings that operate powerfully upon the 
eponymous hero of Wilde’s novel <emphasis effect="italics">The Picture of Dorian 
Gray</emphasis>. We are told in <emphasis effect="italics">The Picture of Dorian 
Gray</emphasis>, for instance, of a binding “of citron-green leather, with a 
design of gilt trellis-work and dotted pomegranates” (<emphasis effect="italics">Dorian Gray</emphasis>, 304) or of another “powdered” with 
“gilt daisies” connoting the ownership and character of the book’s first owner 
(<emphasis effect="italics">Dorian Gray</emphasis>, 208). Perhaps most famously, 
at a critical juncture within the plot of <emphasis effect="italics">Dorian 
Gray</emphasis>, Wilde’s hero rebinds nine copies of the first edition of a 
powerfully “poisonous” work in different colors so that they might suit the 
”various moods” and… “changing fancies” of his nature (<emphasis effect="italics">Dorian Gray</emphasis>, 276). Ricketts’s binding for <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> is no less arresting than these fictive 
bindings, aggressively calling the eye into play and forcing the reader to 
linger over its composition and material properties. Michael Brooks writes that 
the binding “perfectly exemplifies the style that Ricketts…forged for the whole” 
(Brooks, 312), while Giles Barber writes “the design is perhaps the high point 
of Ricketts’s art and stands at the watershed of the period” (Barber, 329). In 
its “symbolism, its sparse decoration, and highly Japanese vertical lines and 
sliding doors,” adds Barber, “it harks back to Rossetti and the…seventies” while 
“equally its mystic symbolism and its architectural lines, where the curvilinear 
is demoted from pride of place, now look forward to the rectilinear style 
popular in Britain after 1900” (Barber, 329). As important, the binding’s gilt 
surfaces catch the light and glitter as the book is moved, throwing into relief 
the two-dimensional flatness of Ricketts’s “figures,” and suggesting a 
“mysterious lost-and-found quality” beyond the reach of “any normal tonal range” 
(Lamb, 137). </para>

Caslon capitals, Ricketts’s binding invites us to see the poem it contains as a 
monumental and wondrous <emphasis effect="italics">thing</emphasis>. This is 
true of the book’s title page too, which defies all the usual expectations: 
where the title pages of trade books almost invariably occupy a right-hand or 
“recto” page, Ricketts’s for <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> is 
printed on a left-hand or “verso” page, facing the poem’s opening; and it 
relegates the book’s publication information, and even the author’s name, to the 
margins in order to concentrate our attention all the more forcibly on the 
elaborate vine-like composition occupying the center of the page, printed in 
rust-colored ink.<footnote id="id14363165">The bibliographic details, including 
the title and author’s name, appear to have been an afterthought so far as 
Ricketts personally was concerned. Ricketts’s original drawing for the title 
page (see <emphasis effect="italics">The Turn of A Century</emphasis>, 18) does 
not contain or allow for these features, suggesting that it was originally 
executed, like the other full-page “illustrations” in the book, merely as one of 
the ten “designs” specified in Ricketts’s contract with Wilde and Mathews and 
Lane. In the resulting book, eight of these other “designs” occupy a full page, 
and one occupies a half page, though in each case they resist the accepted logic 
of illustration and demand to be treated as decorative, imaginative artworks in 
their own right. See also n. 11 above. In this respect, Ricketts’s designs 
operate similarly to Aubrey Beardsley’s pictures to Wilde’s <emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis>, though whether Ricketts influenced Beardsley 
or vice versa remains a matter of conjecture. For Beardsley’s refusal to 
“illustrate,” see Frankel, <emphasis effect="italics">Masking The 
Text</emphasis>, 153-89.</footnote> Here, as with others of Ricketts’s title 
pages for Wilde’s books,<footnote id="id17175534">See Frankel, <emphasis effect="italics">Oscar Wilde’s Decorated Books</emphasis>, 120-23 and 143-45; 
also <emphasis effect="italics">Masking the Text</emphasis>, 191-93.</footnote> 
the reader is torn between conceptualizing the page as a representational entity 
and a purely decorative one. The juxtaposition of the figure identified as 
“Melancholia” with the semi-human “sphinx,” reaching longingly for fruit 
positioned agonizingly just out of reach, invites us to read the design 
symbolically as a “representation” of insatiable desire and its consequences. 
But equally the page demands to be understood “decoratively” for the sheer 
exuberance of its curvilinear composition and for the sense of beauty exhibited 
by its snaking, vine-like, forms. At this level, it exists only to be 
appreciated for its own sake, as the embodiment of what Wilde once called a 
“beautiful untrue thing” (“The Decay of Lying,” 320). Like the wallpapers, 
fabric designs, and book borders of William Morris, or the beautiful floral 
border designs that Ricketts would himself print in later years for books 
emanating from his Vale Press, its “only excuse…is that one admires it 
intensely” (Preface to <emphasis effect="italics">Dorian Gray</emphasis>, 236). 
</para>
      <para id="id16112118">Perhaps most important, the title-page to <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> is the first of many pages to be printed 
in three colors, and it must have been especially breathtaking to the poem’s 
first readers on this account. The Victorian period contains few precedents for 
the manner in which Ricketts has used color, both on the title page and 
throughout <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>, to integrate 
strictly visual material and letterpress text. For instance, the rust-colored 
ink utilized first for the title page “Melancholia” design is used again 
repeatedly, throughout the book, for the title words (“The Sphinx”) of the 
book’s running header. Similarly, green ink is utilized throughout to achieve a 
series of visual “rhymes” between illuminated capital letters and catchwords, on 
the one hand, and the bibliographic data listed on the title page. Though green 
ink has admittedly been confined to strictly “textual” materials in each case, 
the effect of Ricketts’s use of it is to highlight such materials as visual and 
material phenomena, thereby integrating them with other colored and visual 
elements of the book. </para>
      <para id="id14316973">This integration of text and vision through color is 
all the more remarkable when we consider that fine color printing was still a 
great luxury in the 1890s, especially where letterpress printing was involved. 
Chromolithography, a planographic technique for the printing of color perfected 
in the early Victorian period, had been utilized previously with great success 
in such works as Owen Jones’s <emphasis effect="italics">The Grammar of 
Ornament</emphasis> (1856) or Henry Noel Humphreys’s <emphasis effect="italics">The Art of Illumination</emphasis> (1849), but it required 
colors to be printed—at great expense of time and money—on a separate “plate” 
from the text, often on a different paper. Already on the wane by the 1870s, 
chromolithography was best suited to works of abstract and geometric design, but 
it was ill suited to letterpress printing and to book illustration (insofar as 
book illustration requires representational forms), where a more thoroughgoing 
integration of text and design was required (see Frankel, “Ecstasy of 
Decoration” and “The Designer’s Eye”). Wood engraving held more promise so far 
as literary publishers and printers were concerned: a number of printers had 
perfected the art of printing from wood engravings in the 1860s, 1870s and 
1880s, producing color-illustrated books (McLean, 171-204) that are still 
notable both for the excellence of their printing and for the marriage of 
letterpress text with wood-engraved illustration. But such successes were 
usually confined to the children’s and gift book markets or to specialized 
works, such as works of ornithology and botany. Rarely had relief printing in 
color been applied to works of poetry and adult literature; and rarely had the 
text itself been saturated with color.<sup><footnote id="id12480130">There are 
two exceptions to this rule—firstly, the occasional printing of illuminated 
capitals and chapter headings in red ink, especially in religious and 
bibliophile productions. See also n. 25 below. The second exception is 
constituted by many of the books produced for children by Walter Crane, such as 
<emphasis effect="italics">Baby’s Own Aesop</emphasis> (1886) and <emphasis effect="italics">Flora’s Feast</emphasis> (1889), where the text itself is 
printed in color by the process of wood-engraving rather than letterpress 
printing. Wilde wrote a review of <emphasis effect="italics">Flora’s 
Feast</emphasis> upon its appearance in 1889, calling it “as lovely in colour as 
it is exquisite in design” (“Some Literary Notes I,” 390). As stated above, 
Crane provided an important model for Wilde’s own ideas about design. 
</footnote></sup> Even in the hands of master printers such as George Leighton 
and Edmund Evans (the latter of whom printed books by Kate Greenaway and Walter 
Crane, as well as illustrations by Randolph Caldecott), color was almost always 
confined to “illustration” as an accompaniment to the monochrome letterpress 
text. With the exception of Ricketts’s friend Lucien Pissarro (whose Eragny 
Press from 1895 onwards would earn a reputation for finely-printed color wood 
engravings as accompaniments to works of literature), no fine printers or 
private presses associated with the so-called revival of printing had hitherto 
experimented with printing in multiple colors, let alone with using color to 
integrate text and vision.<sup><footnote id="id10364037">The best surveys of the 
so-called revival of printing are Colin Franklin, <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Private Presses</emphasis> (2<sup>nd</sup> ed. Aldershot: Scolar Press, 1991); 
Roderick Cave, <emphasis effect="italics">The Private Press</emphasis> 
(2<sup>nd</sup> ed. New York: Bowker, 1983) and Will Ransom, <emphasis effect="italics">Private Presses and Their Books</emphasis> (1929; rpt. New 
York, AMS Press, 1976). See also Ricketts’s <emphasis effect="italics">A 
Defence</emphasis> and Holbook Jackson, <emphasis effect="italics">The Eighteen 
Nineties: A Review of Art and Ideas at the Close of the Nineteenth 
Century</emphasis> (New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914), 309-23. William Morris 
had been persuaded before 1894 to introduce color into Kelmscott Press books in 
the form of chapter titles and catchwords printed in red (a practice later to be 
imitated by many other private printers, including Ricketts). But Morris 
utilized red ink only sparingly and was averse to the introduction of any other 
colors. </footnote></sup> As Ricketts rightly observed in 1899, <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> “is the first book of the modern revival 
printed in three colours” (<emphasis effect="italics">A Defence</emphasis>, 25), 
and its printing must have been especially eye-opening to its earliest readers 
on this account.</para>
      <para id="id14129870"> The title page, then, obliges us to see the book as 
a printed and decorative entity, and this impulse is sustained when we begin to 
read the poem itself. For the further we venture into the book, the more 
increasingly iconic begin to seem all of its textual elements. As the monastic 
illuminators of the Middle Ages would have appreciated, no greater example of 
text as monument could be given than the illuminated “I” that commences the 
poem, printed in green. This illuminated capital is among the finest to appear 
in a trade publication in the nineteenth century, comparable to the best 
illuminated capitals printed by such private presses as the Kelmscott Press, the 
Doves Press, and Ricketts’s own Vale Press in the closing years of the 
nineteenth century. Its effect here, in juxtaposition with the Caslon capitals 
used to print Wilde’s couplets, is to estrange or “aestheticize” an already 
estranged text, making the poem appear all the more monumental and other-
worldly. Like the sphinx itself, it occupies a “dim corner,” its “silent” beauty 
posing an immediate enigma so far as the processes of imagination and cognition 
are concerned:</para>

      <para id="id14279981">The width of the engraving block has, significantly, 
obliged the printer to set <emphasis effect="smallcaps">“my fancy
thinks</emphasis>” on a separate line typographically, 
a visible sign of beauty’s capacity to “tease us out of thought.” Even as the 
poem commences, the page visibly foreshadows the derangement of the speaker’s 
mind that will result from his engagement—or failure of engagement—with the 
sphinx. </para>
      <para id="id6387973">But as with Poe’s “The Raven,” this derangement of 
the speaker’s mind, while hinted at obscurely in the opening lines of the poem, 
will only become clear retrospectively. And as with many other Victorian 
dramatic monologues, the opening lines invite us to read the monologue as an 
interpersonal or social drama. The fact that the monologue possesses 
psychological interest for what it reveals “ironically” of its speaker’s mind, 
or the suggestion that the poem’s addressee might not be as wholly “present” as 
the speaker believes, will become clear only through hindsight. The opening 
lines of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis>, then, contain little 
in themselves to suggest the unsettling psychological toll that the sphinx’s 
silence will later take on the poem’s speaker. Thus the poem commences with the 
speaker confidently imagining that the sphinx, far from being inanimate, is 
sensate, half-human, and can be brought to life if he only poses the right form 
of address: </para>

      <para id="id12202292"><newline count="2"/>These questions and apostrophes serve two principal 
purposes. On one level, they deliver the poem's speaker over completely to the 
task of "imagining" the sphinx; and so they very quickly become more fanciful, 
baroque, and more fully eroticized, like those driving Swinburne’s poem 
“Faustine” (which consciously or unconsciously Wilde’s lines recall). As a 
result, the sphinx itself—like the implied addressees of such “dramatic” 
monologues as Tennyson’s “Locksley Hall” or “St. Simeon Stylites”—quickly 
disappears from view, and the poem gives itself up to a purely imaginative 
excursion. On this level, the poem is technically what Tennyson would call a 
<emphasis effect="italics">monodrama,</emphasis> and the sphinx itself is merely 
the catalyst or spark that ignites the speaker's excessive imagination. 
Consequently, our immediate impulse is to focus critically not on what the 
sphinx actually <emphasis effect="italics">is</emphasis> (a question the poem 
does not answer), but on the dreamlike effects produced “in” the poem's speaker 
by his confrontation with it. As Regenia Gagnier has observed, at this level the 
poem is finally a poem of (auto)seduction, ripe for psychoanalysis: "The poem is 
a poem of excess in the sense that the object of desire is technically absent; 
the desire compulsively flows from the subject's brain. But the consummate 
mastery, the <emphasis effect="italics">style</emphasis>, of having the shy 
beloved <emphasis effect="italics">seduce himself</emphasis> must be admired" 
(Gagnier, 45).</para>
      <para id="id10007147"> But this is not the only level on which the 
speaker's mad interrogation of the sphinx can be understood. For Wilde’s speaker 
possesses a neophyte’s pretensions to scholarship, and he lives, metaphorically 
at least, in an ivory tower, as the lines “<emphasis effect="smallcaps">dawn 
shivers round the grey gilt-
dialled towers, and the rain/ streams down each diamonded pane</emphasis>” would 
seem to 
indicate. His obsessive questioning of the Sphinx is driven at bottom, then, by 
an archaeological and historicist impulse, centered on the problem of defining 
just what an accurate knowledge of the sphinx might consist of. Insofar as the 
sphinx exists simply as an object or relic, “<emphasis effect="smallcaps">beautiful and silent… somnolent… 
statuesque,</emphasis>” its existence constitutes an unbearable enigma to his 
neophyte 
scholar’s imagination; and his questions are, in one sense at least, historicist 
attempts to “know” the sphinx using the language of philology and myth, 
especially insofar as this approach had become a critical reflex among students 
of archaeology in the nineteenth century. </para>
      <para id="id6487254"> Like the neophytes at the beginning of Wilde’s play 
<emphasis effect="italics">Salome</emphasis>, then, the speaker of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> poses a series of increasingly monstrous

those questions remain unanswered:</para>

century Orientalist mythology. Yet here they only point up the "<emphasis effect="smallcaps">songless 
tongueless</emphasis>" condition of the sphinx and draw our attention to the 
massive irony 
that, for all the breadth of the Orientalist pseudo-knowledge employed by the 
speaker, the sphinx finally remains as silent and unknown as at the beginning. 
The monologue’s speaker proceeds on the assumption that if he employs the right 
hermeneutic, the sphinx will finally yield its truth. Like the practical critic 
he is, he assumes that the sphinx contains its own meanings and can be <emphasis effect="italics">glossed</emphasis> (both in the sense of having its truth 
revealed by way of attached commentary, and in the more medieval sense of 
<emphasis effect="italics">glozed</emphasis> or "peered into"). But these 
assumptions only lead to his intellectual and psychological breakdown
("<emphasis effect="smallcaps">get 
hence, you loathsome mystery!.../ you make my creed a barren sham, you wake foul 
dreams of sensual life</emphasis>"); the excesses of Orientalist myth, projected 
onto the 
sphinx as "<emphasis effect="smallcaps">poisonous melodies,</emphasis>" are
finally no match for the "<emphasis effect="smallcaps">steadfast
gaze</emphasis>" 
and "<emphasis effect="smallcaps">sullen ways</emphasis>" of the object he 
faces. So the sphinx remains as much a 
"<emphasis effect="smallcaps">loathsome mystery</emphasis>" at the poem's end, 
at which point superstition has usurped 
the speaker’s will to knowledge, as it was at the beginning.</para>
      <para id="id6799119"> At this level, the poem can be read as about 
archaeological knowledge itself, at least as put to use within a late-Victorian 
Orientalist context. The sphinx then represents the absolute object faced by the 
archaeologist (the "relic"), ultimately indifferent to the scholar’s naive 
attempts to appropriate it to a mythologically inflected historicism. The 
breakdown faced by the poem's speaker, according to this account, represents the 
collapse faced by Orientalist knowledge itself, and it must have been one with 
which many nineteenth-century Egyptologists and Orientalists were 
familiar.</para>
      <para id="id11617506"> But as Henley’s review of the poem demonstrates, 
the processes of reading also frequently break down when readers of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> misconstrue the striking format of the 
1894 book. And just as the speaker’s imagined resuscitation of the sphinx 
involves a willful blindness to its somnolence or “<emphasis effect="smallcaps">statuesque</emphasis>” objectivity, a 
certain deafness to its unyielding silence, so reading the poem involves a 
certain blindness to the material and visual “distractions” offered by the 
book’s illustrations, decorations, type-design and paper. For these features 
declare their parity or integrity with the poem itself, at every turn of the 
page, without ever threatening to overwhelm it. They embody what Jerome McGann 
would call the poem’s “textual condition.” When we take these features into 
account, the book enacts an archaeological problematic very similar to the one 
played out at the poem’s semantic level. Just as the silent curio in the dim 
corner of the speaker’s room points up all the more sharply the “excess” 
implicit in his mythic constructions of it, so the book’s decorations short-
circuit the customary processes of reading, making self-conscious our desire to 
consume or to interpret the poem, as if the poem were somehow conscious of the 
historical problem posed by the event of its own reading. In this sense, 
<emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> constructs itself as a relic 
even as its archaeological “referent” recedes from view. </para>
      <para id="id12955592"> So we find ourselves in the same position reading 
the 1894 book as the speaker reading the sphinx "in" the poem. The book too is 
"<emphasis effect="smallcaps">songless tongueless," "beautiful and
silent</emphasis>"; and self-evidently it also 
"<emphasis effect="smallcaps">wake[s] in me each bestial sense.</emphasis>" Even 
before reading has gotten under way, as 
we have seen, the poem disappears into the sheer mass of the book, and the 
reading process gets undermined by material signifiers that stare us in the face 
at every turn of the page. Although the text is not actually illegible, the 
sheer variety of experimentation involved in its printing makes it extremely 
distracting to read: on many pages, the poem’s lines have been pushed to the 
margins and, on others, the poem appears eccentrically spatialized by the page’s 
overall appearance of whiteness (or what Henley terms “blankness”). Illuminated 
capitals, illustrations, colored inks, isolated catchwords, and Ricketts’s 
strict adherence to Whistler-esque principles of asymmetry in the book’s 
typography<footnote id="id12265743">While commonly associated with Mallarmé’s 
<emphasis effect="italics">Un Coup de Dés</emphasis> (Paris, 1897), the 
typographic asymmetry of <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> 
derives largely from Ricketts’s absorption of principles developed in the 
pamphlets and books of the painter James McNeill Whistler. See Frankel, 
<emphasis effect="italics">Masking The Text</emphasis>, 223-49 and <emphasis effect="italics">Oscar Wilde’s Decorated Books</emphasis>, 94-99.</footnote> all 
call our attention to the print medium while possessing considerable visual 
artistry in their own right. The result is a visual phantasmagoria that makes it 
extremely difficult to concentrate on “the poem itself.” By the end, the book 
has become not merely the poem's vehicle; to all intents and purposes, it has 
become the sphinx <emphasis effect="italics">itself</emphasis>, embodying an 
“archaelogical” decorativity that the poem can only attempt to grasp adequately. 
Clearly, this is what Stephen Calloway means when he says that the book is the 
“most harmonious” of all Ricketts’s productions and that it "precisely mirrors 
the exquisite and perverse text" (Calloway, 44) or what Percy Muir means by 
calling the book “an ideal setting for the artificiality of Wilde’s text” (Muir, 
193). As the <emphasis effect="italics">Pall Mall Budget</emphasis>’s reviewer 
had written in 1894, "the vellum binding, the various symbolic designs, the 
quaint rubricated initials and the general arrangement of the text, all by Mr. 
Ricketts' sympathetic art, are most subtly infused by the spirit of the poem" 
(“The City of Books,” quoted in Millard, <emphasis effect="italics">Bibliography</emphasis>, 393). </para>
      <para id="id12221801"> Nonetheless, saying that the decorated book 
<emphasis effect="italics">mirrors</emphasis> Wilde's text needs qualification, 
because the relation between book and poem is not one of simple parity or 
reflection. Rather, the decorated book poses in real and perceptual terms what 
the poem rehearses at an imaginative level. To this degree, the problems posed 
by the decorated book of 1894 lend the poem an urgency that it lacks when 
printed conventionally. In its 1894 edition, the poem demands to be seen in its 
integrity with Ricketts’s marvelous designs. To see it for anything more or less
—to abstract the poem from the decorated book, on the assumption that the book 
is immaterial—is to commit precisely the error that leads the poem’s speaker to 
his grotesque misconstrual of the relic that presents itself to his eyes, 
culminating in his eventual mysticism and breakdown.</para>
      <para id="id12860936"> As the <emphasis effect="italics">Pall Mall 
Budget</emphasis>’s reviewer had understood, this materializing or 
“archaeologizing” spirit extends to Wilde’s language as much as to the book 
itself. For Wilde’s language is itself a highly material entity, a “sort of 
processional, of beautiful words strangely shaped and coloured,” whose 
underlying “meaning” remains constantly just out of reach, and may be less 
important than its power of suggestion or affect: “How many of us…know the 
nature of ‘rods of oreichalch’?” The strangeness of Wilde’s diction, the 
obscurity of his allusions, and the neat closure of Wilde’s rhymes remain ends 
in themselves, their self-consciousness entirely “necessary to give that sense 
of mysterious luxury at which Mr. Wilde is aiming.” For “poetical purposes,” as 
the <emphasis effect="italics">Budget</emphasis>’s reviewer perceptively wrote, 
it were better that the “meaning” of the “strangely named beings and things that 
load every rift” remain obscure lest “the meaning…clash with the beautiful 
sound” (“The City of Books,” 164). </para>
      <para id="id14317771">For this reason, a decision has been made to offer 
no Glossary of terms, myths, and allusions in the present edition, and readers 
have been left to construe for themselves the nature of a <emphasis effect="italics">hippogriff</emphasis>, a <emphasis effect="italics">basilisk</emphasis>, and an <emphasis effect="italics">ivory-horned </emphasis><emphasis effect="italics">tragelaphos</emphasis>. The poem’s 
speaker, after all, presents us with an object lesson in the price to be paid 
for imagining that works of art can be (mis)construed by reference to the world 
of objective fact. As Wilde had written previously, “aesthetic value… does not 
in the slightest degree, depend on…facts, but on the Truth, and Truth is 
independent of facts always, inventing or selecting them at pleasure” (“The 
Truth of Masks,” 423). Like the literature of the northern hemisphere of 
Borges’s “Tlön,” <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> abounds not in 
real things but in “ideal objects, which are convoked and dissolved in a moment, 
according to poetic needs… [The] word forms a <emphasis effect="italics">poetic 
object</emphasis> created by the author” (Borges, 435-36, my translation). For a 
similar reason, no attempt has been made to supply annotations clarifying or 
“realizing” the historical identities (if any) of such mythic gods as Ammon, 
Pasht, Adon, and Memnon; and to point up any “mistakes,” “inaccuracies,” or 
“anachronisms” (Murray, 74) in Wilde’s allusions is to miss the fundamentally 
imaginative and poetic nature of those allusions. If, as Wilde maintained, “the 
only real people are the people who never existed” (“The Decay of Lying,” 297), 
Ammon, Pasht, Adon, and Memnon are entirely fictive and artistic creations, who 
possess no life outside the work itself. And Wilde would surely say the same of 
such terms as <emphasis effect="italics">oreichalch</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">hippogriffs</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">catafalque</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">nenuphar</emphasis>. In other contexts, these terms might 
denote things that exist in this world. But in <emphasis effect="italics">The 
Sphinx</emphasis>, “there is an abundance of incredible systems of pleasing 
design or sensational type” (Borges, 436, my translation), and these words’ 
sounds and other-worldliness are everything. As Wilde had written, what the 
materials of art “suggest, what imitative parallel may be found to them in that 
chaos that is termed Nature, is a matter of no importance…. A thing in Nature 
becomes much lovelier if it reminds us of a thing in Art, but a thing in Art 
gains no real beauty through reminding us of a thing in Nature. The primary 
aesthetic impression of a work of art borrows nothing from recognition or 
resemblance. (<emphasis effect="italics">Complete Letters</emphasis>, 502). Like 
the metaphysicians of Tlön, Wilde does “not seek for the truth or even for 
verisimilitude, but rather for a kind of amazement” (Borges, 436, my 
translation). As much as it represents a central work of the Decadent Movement 
as a whole, <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> is arguably the 
central work of Wilde’s creative mind and the ultimate embodiment of Wilde’s 
ideas about the power of artifice and the nature of art. It expresses nothing, 
but it suggests everything. <emphasis effect="italics">The Sphinx</emphasis> is 
the consummate example of Wilde’s notion that “the artist is the creator of 
beautiful things” (Preface to <emphasis effect="italics">Dorian Gray</emphasis>, 
235). </para>
